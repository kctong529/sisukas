        "en": "This course applies a process approach to learning, in which students plan, prepare, practise and deliver an informative presentation on a topic from their own fields of study. Students start out by analysing their background and experiences as presenters and users of English in order to establish personal goals and areas of development. Students watch and analyse presentations in order to discuss elements of effective presentations. Students plan their talk for academic, non-expert audiences by creating an outline, including the introduction, body, and conclusion as well as transitions.

Kestävyysajattelu, -vaatimukset ja lainsäädäntö eivät ainoastaan luo uusia liiketoiminnan mahdollisuuksia. Ne edellyttävät merkittävää sopeutumista myös nykyiseltä liiketoiminnalta, järjestelmiltä, johtamiselta ja organisoitumiselta – kulutuksesta puhumattakaan. Kurssin lähtökohtana on, että yrityksillä ja muilla organisaatioilla on keskeinen yhteiskunnallinen rooli kestävän muutoksen ajureina.\r\nKurssi tarjoaa opiskelijoille kokonaisymmärryksen ja perustan kestävän liiketoiminnan periaatteista ja käytännöistä. Se antaa opiskelijoille valmiuksia analysoida ja suunnitella kestäviä periaatteita noudattavia ratkaisuja. Kurssi luo vahvat perusteet kestävän liiketoiminnan johtamiselle, korostaen ekologisesti ja sosiaalisesti kestävää kehitystä liiketoiminnan eri osa-alueilla.\r\nKurssilla käsitellään muun muassa seuraavia kysymyksiä: Mitä tarkoittavat kestävästi toimiva talous ja liiketoiminta, ja miten niitä ohjataan? Miten kestävyys ilmenee organisaatioiden eri osa-alueilla, kuten tuotantoprosesseissa, investoinneissa, johtamisessa ja strategiatyössä? Kuinka kiertotalous, kestävä palvelutalous ja innovaatiot vaikuttavat kestävän liiketoiminnan edistämiseen?",
        "sv": "Hållbar utveckling inkluderas heltäckande i olika delar av verksamheten. Hållbarhetstänkande, -krav och lagstiftning skapar inte bara nya affärsmöjligheter. De kräver också betydande anpassning från befintlig verksamhet, system, ledning och organisering - inte minst när det gäller konsumtion. Utgångspunkten för kursen är att företag och andra organisationer har en central samhällelig roll som drivkrafter för hållbar förändring.\r\nKursen ger studenterna en övergripande förståelse och grund för principer och metoder för hållbart företagande. Den ger studenterna färdigheter att analysera och planera lösningar som följer hållbara principer. Kursen skapar starka grunder för ledning av hållbart företagande, med tonvikt på ekologisk och social hållbarhet inom olika affärsområden.\r\nKursen behandlar bland annat följande frågor: Vad innebär hållbar ekonomi och företagande, och hur styrs de? Hur manifesteras hållbarhet inom olika områden av organisationer, såsom produktionsprocesser, investeringar, ledning och strategiarbete? Hur påverkar cirkulär ekonomi, hållbar tjänsteekonomi och innovationer främjandet av hållbart företagande?",
        "en": "Sustainable development is comprehensively integrated into various aspects of business. Sustainability thinking, requirements, and legislation not only create new business opportunities but also require significant adaptation from existing business, systems, management, and organization – not to mention consumption. The starting point of the course is that companies and other organizations play a crucial societal role as drivers of sustainable change.\r\nThe course provides students with a comprehensive understanding and foundation of the principles and practices of sustainable business. It equips students with the ability to analyze and plan solutions that adhere to sustainable principles. The course establishes a strong foundation for sustainable business management, emphasizing ecological and social sustainability across various business areas.\r\nThe course addresses questions such as: What does a sustainably functioning economy and business mean, and how are they guided? How does sustainability manifest itself in different areas of organizations, such as production processes, investments, management, and strategic work? How do circular economy, sustainable service economy, and innovations contribute to the promotion of sustainable business?"
