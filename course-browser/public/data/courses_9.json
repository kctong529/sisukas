The course will address topics such as: Moore&#39;s Law and the second half of the chessboard; digitization and competitive advantage; infrastructure and e-commerce; cloud computing and Big Data; Internet of Things; artificial intelligence and the implications of all these changes in business and society.",
        "en": "This course focuses on the rapid change from autonomous vehicles to Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things and everything in between that has been brought about by Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) over the past few years. We are now living during a turning point in society, when individuals, firms and societies are becoming rapidly digitized, and thanks to the exponential nature of change in ICT, these changes will only accelerate over time. The adoption of digital methods of doing business has become a prerequisite for success for firms in the digital age. Any firm that fails to respond appropriately to this paradigm shift will succumb to competition in the digital age. In this course, we explore how to manage and ride this change as individuals, as a firm or as a society. The course will address topics such as: Moore&#39;s Law and the second half of the chessboard; digitization and competitive advantage; infrastructure and e-commerce; cloud computing and Big Data; Internet of Things; artificial intelligence and the implications of all these changes in business and society."

Market-based development does not offer a panacea for poverty-alleviation, but rather offers a powerful set of tools that work in some situations. As such, we will discuss when market-based approaches, such as microfinance, value-chain development, entrepreneurial training, and last-mile provisions, are appropriate and effective. Moreover, we will help students understand how to effectively structure interventions by focusing on three key pillars: <ul><li>Context: interventions must be appropriately tailored to the specific political, institutional, scarcity, and historical contexts.</li><li>Partnerships: given the complexity of market-based development, partnerships involving different NGOs, businesses, and government entities are critical.</li><li>Ethics: it is imperative to understand the fundamental power imbalances at play, as well as the importance of not presupposing that outsiders (especially Europeans versed in a different institutional context) know what is best for local communities.</li></ul> To help us understand the complexities and nuances of all of these topics, the course will have a number of guest speakers who represent a cross-section of the actors involved in market-based development. Moreover, students will have the opportunity to integrate this learning by undertaking a final group-based project focused on providing solutions to the challenges encountered in real-world market-based development interventions.",

Remaining seats are prioritized as follows:<br />1. Finance M.Sc. exchange students from other universities<br />2. Aalto Finance B.Sc. students with a finished B.Sc. thesis (registered in transcript of records) <br />3. All other M.Sc. students at the School of Business <br />4. All other M.Sc. students at Aalto <br /><br />Please carefully follow the registration deadlines of the courses and exams! Missing registration deadline automatically foregoes a guaranteed seat for Finance M.Sc. courses and puts prospective student at the bottom of the prioritization list.</p>"
