        "en": "During the course, the student will be introduced participatory planning as a multifaceted, sometimes contested field with various approaches, ideals and methodologies. These approaches have evolved during the (rather short) history of participatory planning. The varying viewpoint concern for example:\r\n<ul><li><b>How participation is organized</b>? Participatory planning can be formally organized but also informal, self-organized activity.Who are the participants? The participants can be either organized groups or randomly selected individuals.</li><li><b>What kind of knowledge participatory planning produces</b>? The knowledge produced in participatory planning process can be both generalizable and scientific or specific and local.</li><li><b>What is the focus of participatory planning</b>? The focus of participatory planning can be on the process or on the outcome. The scale of participatory planning can be the master plan level or detailed plan level.</li><li><b>Which methods should/can be used in participatory planning</b>?

        "en": "Non-destructive testing (NDT) has a number of important roles to play in ensuring the through-life quality and reliability of many important products whose integrity is of paramount importance. The traditional role of NDT in quality control during manufacture - predominantly defect detection - has been complemented in recent years with increasingly important inspections in-service on plant and equipment at varying stages through life. The correct application of NDT can prevent accidents, save lives, protect the environment and avoid economic loss.\r\nNDT and inspection are vital functions in achieving the goals of efficiency and quality at an acceptable cost. In many cases, these functions are highly critical: painstaking procedures are adopted to provide the necessary degree of quality assurance. The consequences of failure of engineering materials, components and structures are well known and can be disastrous.\r\nIn the present course the students will review the physical fundaments of the main NDT techniques and will be presented to the most relevant variants of the conventional NDT techniques. Focus will be given to the establishment of the morphology, localization and dimension of the defects typical in many engineering materials and resulting from the application of several manufacturing techniques.\r\n "
