The view is that of multinational corporation (MNC) rather than of a small company. The course examines the key questions in strategic management: how to create value and how to achieve and maintain competitive advantage in the framework of global business. The course introduces the traditional process-based perspective on strategy and discusses strategizing as an action in a continuously changing environment. It discusses from strategic perspective the key issues, opportunities and challenges in global business arena. It addresses globalization and the consequent changes in firms operating environment and analyzes the needs to adjust firms strategies and operations due to these changes. The key concepts and principles of leading and managing business in the international dimension, including issues in various functions, such as HR and marketing are discussed. The role of politics, political risks and regulation are covered, including world trade issues. A thorough look is taken into the premises that various countries as location provide for companies in terms of competitiveness. The purpose of the course is to a) present the most important forces affecting global strategy development today, b) introduce and analyze the suitability of different strategies, and c) present the ways to organize, coordinate and control international activities. Main contents of the module are: strategic planning, global business environment, globalization of firms and industries, global strategy and growth, competition and competitiveness, location decisions, world politics &amp; business, global trade, economic integration, global integration &amp; local adaptation, planning and managing business globally. The objectives of the course are to learn: the tools and frameworks to develop strategy for global business, skills in analyzing global markets, to assess various ways to organize business for global markets, and to plan and organize for different business environments.",

For instance:\n<ul><li>Though there are ‘win-wins’ out there, there are inevitably trade-offs between social, environmental, and financial goals; a venture may have to sacrifice some environmental value if it is to be financially sustainable.</li><li>There are temporal trade-offs; a venture that favours financial viability in the short term may be better positioned to accomplish social or environmental goals in the long term</li><li>Ventures must set boundaries on the system that they want to change; the world is full of problems, but systems change is hard, and a venture that tries to change too many things at once is almost certainly destined to fail.

Given that the majority of the world’s economic activity happens through markets, it is critical to understand the role that market-based activity might have in causing this change. Though we will briefly talk about corporations, our primary focus is on entrepreneurship, as entrepreneurship is how new ideas enter the marketplace, and how society is pushed to change.  When examining systems change, we will be very pragmatic about what is, and is not, possible. Make no mistake, systems change is hard.\nWe then change the level of our analysis, moving from the systems level down to the venture level. Here, our focus is understanding how and why sustainable entrepreneurship is hard for companies; it is critical to systems change, but it is hard. Indeed, entrepreneurs encounter a multitude of tensions whilst trying to use their ventures to cause systems change. For instance:\n<ul><li>Though there are ‘win-wins’ out there, there are inevitably trade-offs between social, environmental, and financial goals; a venture may have to sacrifice some environmental value if it is to be financially sustainable.</li><li>There are temporal trade-offs; a venture that favours financial viability in the short term may be better positioned to accomplish social or environmental goals in the long term</li><li>Ventures must set boundaries on the system that they want to change; the world is full of problems, but systems change is hard, and a venture that tries to change too many things at once is almost certainly destined to fail. This may mean that ventures pay little attention to some issues that are very important, but are beyond their core focus</li></ul>\nWith these tensions in mind, this course will take a pragmatic approach. Above all else, I want you to understand that sustainable entrepreneurship is brutally difficult (this is, after all, the third time I’ve mentioned difficulty). If it were easy, many systems would have been changed by now. We need to recognize this difficulty, because only once we recognize this complexity that we can address it.\nFinally, also note what this course is NOT doing: it is not helping you design your own sustainable start-up. ",
