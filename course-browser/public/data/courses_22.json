Channel model characteristics including path loss, large-scale fading, small-scale fading models and spatial consistency will be discussed.  The  differences of Milimeter-Wave and microwave models  will be  explained.  Several radio channel simulators  will be introduced.\nModule II: Massive MIMO and Beam Management:\nMassive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is an important technology in 5G and B5G  systems. Beam management procedures are used to acquire and maintain a set of beam pair links (a beam used at gNB paired with a beam used at user equipment). These procedures aim to maintain high-quality communication links despite challenges like path loss, blockages, and rapid changes in user equipment position and orientation.  We  will discuss  some use cases of applying machine learning for beam management in future communication systems.\n \nModule III: Radio-frequency Positioning:\nLocation awareness is essential for enabling location based services and for improving network management in future communication systems. We will discuss the use of radio frequency  based approaches to localization. We review the radio frequency  features and techniques  that can be utilized for positioning. We will discuss the challenges for indoor positioning and utilize machine learning techniques to address these challenges.\nModule IV: Channel Charting and Applications:\nChannel charting is a self-supervised machine learning framework,  that  is applied to  the channel state information  of the users in  wireless systems  to create a logical radio map of radio environment. The  channel  chart  can be  then used for several  radio resource management applications. We will study   dimensionality reduction techniques   that  can be used for channel charting  and discuss several  radio resource management applications based on  channel charting.\n \nModule V:   Neural Network Structures and Applications\nWe will study neural network structures and concepts   to jointly optimize the transmitter and receiver in communication system  by a single process.  We will utilize the  autoencoder structure to represent the end-to-end  communication system.\n ",

Channel models appropriate for Fifth Generation (5G) and Beyond Fifth Generation (B5G) systems will be studied. Channel model characteristics including path loss, large-scale fading, small-scale fading models and spatial consistency will be discussed.  The  differences of Milimeter-Wave and microwave models  will be  explained.  Several radio channel simulators  will be introduced.\nModule II: Massive MIMO and Beam Management:\nMassive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is an important technology in 5G and B5G  systems. Beam management procedures are used to acquire and maintain a set of beam pair links (a beam used at gNB paired with a beam used at user equipment). These procedures aim to maintain high-quality communication links despite challenges like path loss, blockages, and rapid changes in user equipment position and orientation.  We  will discuss  some use cases of applying machine learning for beam management in future communication systems.\n \nModule III: Radio-frequency Positioning:\nLocation awareness is essential for enabling location based services and for improving network management in future communication systems. We will discuss the use of radio frequency  based approaches to localization. We review the radio frequency  features and techniques  that can be utilized for positioning. We will discuss the challenges for indoor positioning and utilize machine learning techniques to address these challenges.\nModule IV: Channel Charting and Applications:\nChannel charting is a self-supervised machine learning framework,  that  is applied to  the channel state information  of the users in  wireless systems  to create a logical radio map of radio environment. The  channel  chart  can be  then used for several  radio resource management applications. We will study   dimensionality reduction techniques   that  can be used for channel charting  and discuss several  radio resource management applications based on  channel charting.\n \nModule V:   Neural Network Structures and Applications\nWe will study neural network structures and concepts   to jointly optimize the transmitter and receiver in communication system  by a single process.  We will utilize the  autoencoder structure to represent the end-to-end  communication system.\n ",

Students are familiar with canonical correlation analysis and they can apply the method in practice. Students know several approaches to discriminant analysis and classification including different depth based methods. They are also able to assess the goodness of the classification. Students are familiar with hierarchical clustering methods and moving centers -type clustering methods and they understand the restrictions of these approaches. Moreover, students are not only able to apply multivariate methods in practice, but they also understand the mathematics and the reasoning behind the methods.\r\n "
