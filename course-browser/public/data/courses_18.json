The course covers the basic principles of textile finishing. It involves the application of various mechanical, thermal, and wet finishing processes to impart the desired properties on textiles. The desired properties may include the dimension stability, weight, drape, appearance, softness, and handle of fabrics, as well as any required functional properties such as resistance to creasing, flames, water, oil, dirt, or bacteria. The environmental aspects of textile finishing will be also highlighted. The following topics will be covered in this course: Introduction to textile finishing Preparatory processes including desizing, scouring, carbonization, bleaching, mercerizing, heat setting Mechanical finishing treatments including calendering, embossing, raising, stabilization, and steaming Chemical finishing treatments including softening, crease-proof, flame/fire retardants, waterproof, anti-soil, anti-insect, anti-static, and anti-microbial Standard methods for assessing finished fabrics Environmental aspects of textile finishing Important regulations and product safety issues related to textile finishing chemicals",

Monimuoto-opetuksessa opit omien oppimistavoitteiden asettamista, sinulle muodostuu opintojen alussa käsitys yliopisto-opiskelun erityispiirteistä, joita ovat mm. akateeminen vapaus, tutkimuslähtöisyys, kriittisyys, suunnitelmallisuus, pitkäjänteisyys, kokeilevuus, kekseliäisyys ja ongelmanratkaisuhakuisuus osana ryhmätyöskentelyä. Lisäksi opiskelija tutustuu tiedeyhteisön rakenteeseen samalla, kun hän suorittaa kurssin haastattelututkimusta opetusta tarjoavissa tutkimusryhmissä Aalto-yliopiston eri korkeakouluissa (ELEC, SCI ja CHEM). Kurssin alussa opiskelija tutustuu työ- ja kemikaaliturvallisuuden perusteisiin ja kestävän kehityksen näkökulmiin omalla alallan.",

Eleverna lär sig att sätta sina egna inlärningsmål och att förstå universitetet studiernas speciella funktioner. Dessutom tar studenten roten till det vetenskapliga samfundet att utföra de olika lärosätena (ELEC, CHEM, SCI), som producerats i samarbete med laborationer. Under kursen förvärvar studerandena de tekniska och vetenskapliga grunderna i rapporteringen, och kand bedömma felkällor i mätningarna. Lärande mål - färdigheter Kursstart, studerande förvärvar grundläggande laboratoriekunskaper, och bekantar si med sysselsättnings och kemiska säkerhetsfrågor. Studenterna blir förtrogna med laboratoriearbetets rutiner, lär sig att använda laboratorieutrustning, kemikalier, och organiskt material inom forskning. Genteknik arbetet får studenterna att tänka på vetenskaplig forskning, estetiska och etiska frågor. Studenterna kommer att lära sig lagarbete, förmåga till problemlösning, kritiskt tänkande, resultatet av de skriftliga och muntliga presentationsteknik och feedback färdigheter. Lärandemål - Ämne Efter genomgången av de praktisk laboratie arbeten och ytterligare de skriftliga forskningsrapporter eleverna kan dra nytta av en rad olika  mikroskopimetoder (ljus, atomkraft, fluorescens-och elektronmikroskopi), undersökning av levande och ickelevande substans och förstå dessa arbetsmetoder. Studenter blir förtrogen med metoden för att fastställa ett antal egenskaper hos ämnet, för att identifiera ett antal biomaterial och lära sig att göra utvalda biomaterial. Under kursen blir studenten medveten om de fysikaliska fenomen och kopplingarna mellan teknik och att förstå potentialen för utnyttjande av fenomen.",
        "en": "Learning outcomes - general skills After completing the course the student will recognize the social impacts in the field of the BioIt degree program and is able to describe research carried out in this field using examples from industry, health care and the academic community. Students learn to set their own learning goals and to understand the special features of university studying, such as. academic freedom, research-orientation, critical thinking, methodical approach, long-term orderliness, and the experimental problem solving utilizing group working. In addition, the student takes root into the scientific community. During the course, students acquire technological and scientific basics of reporting, and assesses the sources of measurement error. Learning objectives - professional skills In the beginning of the course, students acquire basic laboratory work-related skills and familiarize with the employment and chemical safety issues. Students become familiar with the laboratory work practices, learn how to use laboratory equipment and process chemicals. Genetic engineering work of the students make students think about scientific research, aesthetic and ethical issues. Students will learn teamwork, problem-solving skills, critical thinking, written and oral presentation skills, and feedback discussion skills in peer group work. Learning outcomes - substance After completing the hands-on laboratory work and the additional written research papers, the students are able to take advantage of a number of different microscopy methods (light, atomic force, fluorescence and electron microscopy). Students become familiar with the a number of methods used to determine material properties, to identify a number of biomaterials and learn to synthesize selected biomaterials. During the course, the student become aware of several physical phenomena and learn the connections between biomedical technologies and these phenomena. Students understand certain human physiological conditions and learn how to build a device to measure them."
