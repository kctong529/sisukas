# Sisukas

[![CI Pipeline](https://github.com/kctong529/sisukas/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kctong529/sisukas/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A lightweight, fast alternative to the official SISU system for course filtering, [right here](https://sisukas.fly.dev/).

## Why?

Students are frustrated with the official SISU system due to:
- **Limited filters**: Finding relevant courses requires excessive manual searching.
- **Annoying navigation**: It displays only minimal details unless you click into each link.
- **Slow performance**: Multiple requests slow down the experience.

Sisukas provides a **faster, more user-friendly** way to browse and filter courses.
- **Fast and Efficient**: All data is preloaded, no additional requests.
- **Periods**: Intuitive drag-and-drop selection across the year.
- **Boolean Logic**: Combine filters with AND, OR for more refined results.
- **Keyword**: Narrow down results with keywords in course codes or names.
- **Date**: Filter courses by start and end dates to target specific time frames.
- **Major & Minor**: Predefined course lists for specific degrees.

## Balance

- **Compact**: All course information you'd need at a glance, no extra clicks.
- **Unique Toggle**: Show one entry per course code, merging duplicates.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Stack

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Simple, lightweight, and runs efficiently in the browser.
- **Static JSON Database**: Course data is loaded once at startup, ensuring quick performance.

## Data Source

The course data (`courses.json`) was retrieved using the **Aalto Open API**, following the instructions at [3scale Aalto Open API Docs](https://3scale.apps.ocp4.aalto.fi/docs/swagger/open_courses_sisu).

The data was obtained using the `GET /courseunitrealisations` endpoint, with the parameter: `startTimeAfter=2024-01-01`.

Currently, the app uses a cached version of this data to ensure fast performance without making additional API calls.

## Running Locally

To test the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine if you haven't already:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kctong529/sisukas.git
   cd sisukas
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using npm:

   ```sh
   npm ci
   ```

3. **Build the project with Vite**:

   To build the project, run:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This will bundle the project for production. After the build is complete, you'll have the necessary static files in the `/dist` folder.

   Opening `index.html` is useful for testing CSS styles and layout.

4. **Start a simple HTTP server** in your project directory:

   If you have Python installed, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:

   ```sh
   cd dist
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   This will start a local server on port 8000. Alternatively, you can serve the files using any HTTP server of your choice.

5. **Open your browser** and go to the following URL:

   ```sh
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

   **Note**: `courses.json` is blocked when accessed directly via `file://` in the browser (due to browser security restrictions). The local server is required to load `courses.json` properly.
