# Sisukas

[![CI Pipeline](https://github.com/kctong529/sisukas/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kctong529/sisukas/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A lightweight, fast alternative to the official SISU system for course filtering, [right here](https://sisukas.fly.dev/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're a university student in the Finnish education system, you‚Äôve likely encountered the frustrations of the SISU system. With limited filters, navigation that hides key details behind multiple clicks, and a confusing pagination system that makes it easy to lose track, finding courses can feel unnecessarily tedious. Slow performance only adds to the hassle, making the whole experience more cumbersome than it needs to be.

Sisukas provides a **faster, more user-friendly** way to browse and filter courses.
- **Fast and Efficient**: All data is preloaded, no additional requests.
- **Periods**: Intuitive drag-and-drop selection across the year.
- **Boolean Logic**: Combine filters with AND, OR for more refined results.
- **Keyword**: Narrow down results with keywords in course codes or names.
- **Date**: Filter courses by start and end dates to target specific time frames.
- **Major & Minor**: Predefined course lists for specific degrees.

> [!NOTE]
> We are targeting the delicate balance for the right amount of information in the Sisukas app. It features a compact layout that displays all necessary course details at a glance, with no extra clicks. A unique toggle merges duplicate entries, showing only one per course code. The app is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring seamless performance across both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

The Sisukas app is built with Vanilla JavaScript, chosen for its simplicity, lightweight nature, and fast performance in the browser. To ensure quick access, it loads Static JSON Data once at startup, eliminating the need for repeated API calls. The app's development process is optimized with the Vite build tool, which supports ECMAScript modules and handles cache invalidation efficiently. Vitest is used to perform fast, reliable unit tests, ensuring that key features like filtering, sorting, and data handling work correctly with minimal overhead. Finally, for deployment, Fly.io distributes the app across multiple edge locations for global access, while Docker ensures consistent, containerized environments.

> [!NOTE]
> The course data (`courses.json`) was retrieved using the Aalto Open API, following the instructions at [3scale Aalto Open API Docs](https://3scale.apps.ocp4.aalto.fi/docs/swagger/open_courses_sisu).

> The data was obtained using the `GET /courseunitrealisations` endpoint, with the parameter: `startTimeAfter=2024-01-01`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the app uses a cached version of this data to ensure fast performance without making additional API calls. There is no guarantee that the loaded data is the latest information.

## Running Locally

To test the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine if you haven't already:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kctong529/sisukas.git
   cd sisukas
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using npm:

   ```sh
   npm ci
   ```

3. **Build the project with Vite**:

   To build the project, run:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This will bundle the project for production. After the build is complete, you'll have the necessary static files in the `/dist` folder.

   Opening `index.html` is useful for testing CSS styles and layout.

4. **Start a simple HTTP server** in your project directory:

   If you have Python installed, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:

   ```sh
   cd dist
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   This will start a local server on port 8000. Alternatively, you can serve the files using any HTTP server of your choice.

5. **Open your browser** and go to the following URL:

   ```sh
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

   **Note**: `courses.json` is blocked when accessed directly via `file://` in the browser (due to browser security restrictions). The local server is required to load `courses.json` properly.
