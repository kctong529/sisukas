# Sisukas

A lightweight, fast alternative to the official SISU system for course filtering.

## Why?

Students are frustrated with the official SISU system due to:
- **Limited filters**: Finding relevant courses requires excessive manual searching.
- **Annoying navigation**: The system displays only minimal details unless you click into each course link.
- **Slow performance**: Multiple requests slow down the experience.

Sisukas provides a **faster, more user-friendly** way to browse and filter courses.

## Features

- **Fast**: All data is preloaded, so there are no additional requests slowing down interactions.
- **Better Filtering**:
  - Filter by **start and end dates** to find courses in a specific period.
  - Use **keywords in course codes or names** (e.g., `"CS"`, `"ELEC"`, `"MS"`, or `"Design"`) to narrow results.
  - Exclude **exams** by filtering `"Lecture"` in course names.
- **Compact Information**: No unnecessary clicks‚Äîimportant details are displayed immediately.
- **(Upcoming Feature) Filter by description**: Search for courses with relevant topics.

## Technical Stack

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Simple, lightweight, and runs efficiently in the browser.
- **Static JSON Database**: Course data is loaded once at startup, ensuring quick performance.

## Data Source

The course data (`courses.json`) was retrieved using the **Aalto Open API**, following the instructions at [3scale Aalto Open API Docs](https://3scale.apps.ocp4.aalto.fi/docs/swagger/open_courses_sisu).

The data was obtained using the `GET /courseunitrealisations` endpoint, with the parameter: `startTimeAfter=2024-01-01`.

Currently, the app uses a cached version of this data to ensure fast performance without making additional API calls.

## Deployment

Sisukas is live at: [Sisukas](https://sisukas.fly.dev/)

## Running Locally

To test the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine if you haven't already:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kctong529/sisukas.git
   cd sisukas
   ```

   Opening `index.html` is useful for testing CSS styles and layout.

2. **Start a simple HTTP server** in your project directory:

   If you have Python installed, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:

   ```sh
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   This will start a local server on port 8000.

3. **Open your browser** and go to the following URL:

   ```sh
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

   **Note**: `courses.json` is blocked when accessed directly via `file://` in the browser (due to browser security restrictions). The local server is required to load `courses.json` properly.
